### NYC-Taxi-traffic-analysis
#### Objective:
Utilized NYC taxi data to have an univariate analysis, identified weekly and hourly traffic pattern. Compared airport traffic between LGA and JFK airports.
#### Conclusion:
1) Both the median driving speed and total green taxi traffic are periodic by week, and driver tended to speed up on Saturdays and Sundays and slowed down during Weekdays.People traveled most with green taxies on Saturdays, the second travel pike happened on Friday. We could see that the taxi run slowed starting on Sundays and dropped to the lowest point on Monday.
2) There are 13 times more chance of dropping off than pickup for airport taxi trips. This is because green taxies are not allowed to pick up passgeners at airports unless it is prearranged. LGA has a heavier traffic than JFK maybe becuase there is direct metro-rail to JFK. JFK trips are longer and more expensive.
